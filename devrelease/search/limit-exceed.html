                LiteSearch Limits are the boundaries of the dataset which LiteSearch loads in your computer live while using it. Loading the dataset doesnot refers to <span class="code">cookies</span> or <span class="code">local storage</span>, It simply refers to the frontend design of LiteSearch for providing the offline search capablities. It contains a list of websites <span class="code">meta-data</span> which LiteSearch then uses to provide you the searching capablities. All of these are loaded as <span class="code">One-Time-Load</span> which just loads the list of website's meta data in your computer's <span class="code">memory</span> and this is totaly erased by your <code>Web Browser</code> after your quit a LiteSearch Session. Just like any other Search Engine LiteSearch also has a limited amount of data in it's dataset which limits the Searching / Searchable Outcomes during sessions and if you reached level on a search engine then they may use different solutions from each other for telling you that you reached the end of the dataset, What LiteSearch does is that it ranks this LiteSearch Page when you reached the end for telling you what exactly was happened to you.
