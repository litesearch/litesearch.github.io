 - Dev Release
 - Root Release

### Dev Release
**Dev Release** is the release channel where the LightSearch All Updates comes first before comming directly to the <code>Root Release</code> but this LightSearch Release may be broken as here All the LightSearch Even Mini development updates are posted means incomplete features who are still under development may be broken, So be carefull while visiting the **Dev Release**.

**Root Release** is the release channel for the end users who just want to use the LightSearch simply with all the features packed to the search engine without worrying for broken features as **Root Releases** are the complete version of <code>Dev Release</code> which are heavily tested before becomming **Root Release**.

Visting these channels is simple as https://lightsearch.github.io/devrelease is the channel for dev releases and https://lightsearch.github.io/ is the channel for root releases.
